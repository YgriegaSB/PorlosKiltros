# PorlosKiltros
Web PorlosKiltros, the idea is to use this page for the reservations

This website was developed for a veterinarian who wants to start implementing IT solutions, starting with the development of a website for clients to make reservations. I started developing the web design to show how it could look and gave the green light to continue development.

(This web was developed with Flask framework, python and just a simple lines of JS.)

the views are not distributed in different html structures, link the different sections with the buttons in the header. In addition, i decided to implement the whatsapp button, since it was a request from the vet.
